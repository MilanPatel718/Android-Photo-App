# Android-Photo-App
Simple Photo App for Android
Commits up to May 2nd represent collaborative work between a class partner and I. Everything thereafter represents additonal polishing done by me to enhance the application and improve UI elements.

Implemented as of May 2nd:
1) App opens with a display of all album names with buttons to delete, rename, and add new albums (Must hold exisiting album for delete/rename)
2) Albums can be opened where thumbnails of existing photos are shown. Add button opens up phones photos and lets one select different photos to add to album. Must hold thumbnails to delete photos.
3) A photo can be clicked to show an enlarged view of the photo along with its title on the top. A list of tag name value pairs is also shown. From the home page, one can search for these tags and any photos with the tags will be displayed.
4) One can click next and previous to move between photos in enlarged view
5) Basic UI, not very refined for aesthetics
